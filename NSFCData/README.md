#National Natural Science Foundation of China

The NSFC is one of the leading institutions for funding science research in China. Annual Reports are available online through the NSFC's website, though it is in Chinese and difficult to search through. I have compiled data from 2001 to 2019 from the online reports.

Six Major Types of Grants:
General Program Fund (GPF) - 面上项目
Key Program Fund (KPF) - 重点项目
Young Scientists Fund (YSF) - 青年科学基金项目
Less-Developed Region Fund (LDRF) - 地区科学基金项目
Excellent Young Scholars Fund (EYSF) - 优秀青年科学基金项目
National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (DYS) - 国家杰出青年科学基金项目

For each of these six grants, I report on three categories: Total, Math & Physics, and Physics II. For each of these categories, I record the number of applications, the number of approved applications, the amount of funding requested, and the amount of funding approved.

Important Notes on Grant Data:
-	KPF (2002) is missing Physics II
-	DYS (2003-2005) is missing Physics II
-	DYS (2002) is missing completely
-	EYSF data begins in 2015
