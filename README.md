# SchwarzmanCapstone

I participated in the Schwarzman Scholars Program during the 2021-2022 academic year. During this program, I completed a Capstone Project through a Master's Thesis on "The Role of Government in Fundamental Research: Evidence from Chinese High Energy Physics Research". This repository contains the raw data collection, the code of generating graphics, and a copy of the final capstone report that was received by Tsinghua University in May 2022.
