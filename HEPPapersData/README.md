# High Energy Physics Papers from China (2001-2019)

In addition to data on funding fundamental research/high energy physics in China, my capstone also contains data on paper publications.

I use Clarivate to search the Web of Science Collection to find all papers published in China from 2001 to 2019 that concern certain topics related to high energy physics and major experiments in China.

I include papers and their information in my data if either
  1. The paper is about a major HEP research project/experiment in China, such as BESIII or CEPC.
  2. The paper's corresponding author is from a Chinese institution (university or national lab) AND there is a listed source of funding from a government grant, like the NSFC or MOST.

Only papers that pass either of these two requirements are included in my data.
